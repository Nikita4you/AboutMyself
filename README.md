# AboutMyself
Hi, I'm Nikita, 25 y.o. and welcome to my GitHub bio.
I'm based in St.Petersburg, RUS. Ready for relocate.

I have a technical education. Firstly, I worked as design engineer for 3 years, and now I have worked as engineer-metrologist in machine engineering industry for 2 years.
In parallel with my main work, I began to learning programming. My choice was Java because it's multifunctionality with which any roads open.
My study began on the resource: https://javarush.com/users/2236563, where completed about 700 small tasks. Also I use some cource on YouTube, and of cource - literature,
like: Head First Java, Grokking Algorithms, Ð¡lean code. Now, I'm dealing with Git/GitHub, Maven, Spring.

Soft Skills: communicative, teamwork, quick study, responsibility, punctual, pre-intermediate English.

Look at my Pet-project. And I will be glad to consider any of your suggestions.
